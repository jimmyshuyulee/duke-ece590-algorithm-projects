##Ece590 Project1 Sorting
We implement the following **five** algorithms as discussed in class:
- Selection Sort- Insertion Sort- Bubble Sort- Merge Sort- Quick Sort

The sorting task is defined as:
- The input array will have a positive integer length.  - Will not be asked to sort an empty array.  - Could be asked to sort a singleton array.- The elements need not be distinct (i.e. repeats allowed).- The elements can be any (positive or negative) real number.The goal of our sorting algorithm is to sort the elements from the input array into ascending order so that the smallest element is at index 0
