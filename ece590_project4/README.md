## ece590_project4 MST/TSP

We completed three tasks in this project:

1. Implement Prim’s algorithm to find the MST.2. Implement Kruskal’s algorithm to find the MST (along with the disjoint set functions).3. Implement a DFS function to find the tour, once the MST has been found, and use it to approximate the solution for the Traveling SalesmanProblem.
