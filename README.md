# ece590_algorithm_projects
This repositary includes 4 projects for Duke ECE590 - Algorithm.

## Project 1: Sorting  
#### Link: [ece590_project1](https://github.com/jimmyshuyulee/ece590_algorithm_projects/tree/master/ece590_project1)  
In this project, we implemented the following 5 different sorting algorithms.

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Project 2: DFS/BFS  
#### Link: [ece590_project2](https://github.com/jimmyshuyulee/ece590_algorithm_projects/tree/master/ece590_project2)  
In this project, we implemented both DFS and BFS to solve several different mazes.

## Project 3: Arbitrage  
#### Link: [ece590_project3](https://github.com/jimmyshuyulee/ece590_algorithm_projects/tree/master/ece590_project3)  
In this project, we implemented Bellman-Ford to detect arbitrage opportunities given a
set of exchange rates between currencies.

## Project 4: MST/TSP  
#### Link: [ece590_project4](https://github.com/jimmyshuyulee/ece590_algorithm_projects/tree/master/ece590_project4)  
In this project, we implemented both Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for finding a Minimum
Spanning Tree. We then use that MST to approximate the solution for the Traveling Salesman
Problem.
